This is spot, a clean and simple command line interface for Spotify which can
perform searches, list track and album info, and stream or download compressed
Ogg Vorbis audio data from the service.

The spot utility returns a brief usage summary when run without arguments.
Before running it, the environment variables SPOTIFY_USERNAME and
SPOTIFY_PASSWORD should be set to valid Spotify login credentials.

A useful bash shell-function wrapper with completion support on recently found
spotify:album: and spotify:track: URIs is included in spot.bash.

There are no build dependencies apart from libc and OpenSSL libcrypto, but
after successfully downloading tracks, spot will attempt to run vorbiscomment
to tag the resulting files with album and track metadata, and then vorbisgain
to add ReplayGain info. It will warn without aborting if either or both of
these utilities are not available, leaving the output files untagged.
